## Abstract
[CloutWorld](https://bitclout.com/u/CloutWorld) is working on a "video game" centered around Mixed Reality, custom external BCIs (External Privacy-focused Brain Computer Interfaces), and various aspects of computer vision, rendering and virtualization. It aims to feature aspects of P2P peer discovery and is built untop of a variety of technologies. Some of these technologies include [BitClout](https://bitclout.com/), compatibility w/ [CloutContracts](https://cloutcontracts.github.io/), custom hardware by or utilized by [CloutLock](https://bitclout.com/u/CloutLock), and peer discovery as part of a module made w/ the open-source [Decentralized-Internet SDK](https://github.com/Lonero-Team/Decentralized-Internet). Much of the research behind CloutWorld will be experimental, but is aimed to at the very least provide research in a variety of different areas including immersive gaming, mixed reality interfaces, and perhaps even privacy, neuroscience, as well as maybe variations of mechanic responsiveness or soft robotics integrated into clothing. We are not just creating an immersive gaming experience, but also simulating alternative realities and new methods of communication.

## Premise
The premise of CloutWorld and its development is quite simple. For starters, the immersive experience being created must be decentralized and focused on privacy. There is also a huge aspect in regards to the external nature of many of the technologies involved. While, it can't be fully privacy-focused in regards to many of the social features and integrations of CloutWorld as a network, it should be privacy focused in regards to the control of data and connectivity. The secondary aspect obviously, is the experience. As opposed to traditional gaming experiences, there is a heavy reliance on turning your already existing reality into a video game. This means you can walk immersively in your own environment w/ mixed reality and it would build layers or turn pre-existing layers into something seemingly virtualized. The computer vision is what will allow you to interact with your environment. There is also the immersive cognitive experience w/ the custom external brain computer interface.

## Introduction
CloutWorld is a video game aimed off of building an interactive virtualization and communication layer untop of your pre-existing reality or world. The technologies surrounding it, provide both the ability to create immersive experiences as well as immersive forms of communication. Not only does this technology remove the anti-social problems revolved around traditional VR, or the limitations of Mixed Reality as it stands currently, but this technology creates new ways people can communicate with people and interact based off of variations of experimental protocols and haptic feedback integrations.

## Proposal Scope
Something worth noting is that I have been interested in neuron simulation in hardware, at least since 2014. There are also different research scopes which I have integrated in regards to virtual reality and VR experiences for many years prior. Due to limitations centered around funding and my position at the time, the popularity of my research faded away with emerging technologies. However, now given much more tools in my scope, I aim to relaunch various variations of my research through both a scholarly and product market-fit standpoint. The development of CloutWorld, taunted as an overly ambitious video game, is actually a continuation of years worth of research in a variety of different fields.

## Hardware
![mixed_reality_v1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12502053/119936736-a36fb880-bf57-11eb-9452-3d24f54763f2.jpg) \
***Version #1 illustration*** \
The above design which was actually made over 5 years ago, represents what was originally visioned by me as the type of device I want to build from a hardware standpoint. This would be version 1.0, and next variations would likely be far more portable or slick for the user. The front facing camera actually views your surroundings and sends information to a relatively small microcomputer which runs various software drivers. There are multiple computing systems and state machines throughout the device, including one for overlay network connectivity. Likely, one would integrate a privacy-focused external BCI (the BCI I work on) as phase 1, but future BCI phases may revolve around being bone-conduction-based over regular EEG compatibility. The further the technological phases, likely the better the portability and experience.

## Software
As noted, various software integrations come into play. The aspect surrounding computer vision likely may be something similar to ROS or Lidar with underlying privacy integrations added to it. Visualising your surroundings and then creating the virtualization is a very core feature the software needs to integrate. Also integrated are various social aspects surrounding P2P overlays, offline-centric networks, and regular networks as well. Many authentication methods for networks beyond BitClout, such as [Minds.com](https://mind.com) might also be integrated. Next, is the firmware surrounding the custom EEG headsets and hardware designs. 

## Integrations
The integrations have many primary focuses. Outside of privacy, comes experience and social interaction. A variety of the technology in the beginning surrounding the development of CloutWorld will likely be highly experimental. Over time, there should be a higher degree of stability in regards to the technological integrations and network latency. There will also need to be a huge emphasis on what type of features would be integrated in regards to haptic feedback and sensory or audio-sensory modules. 

### Milestones
The core of this project is to at the very least, focus on releasing tangible research within the field and target area that CloutWorld is interested in. If there are limitations in regards to hardware or actual tangible releases, but enough research or software is released for an advancement within this industry, that in itself is a success. There is an emphasis however, on actual development and hardware designs in relation to CloutWorld along w/ the software.
